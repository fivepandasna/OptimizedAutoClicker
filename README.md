**OptimizedAutoClicker** is a highly efficient autoclicker written in C++. It is designed to deliver precise and fast clicking performance. Unlike other autoclickers, this tool can reliably handle timings below 10ms. Use with caution at such high speeds.

## Features

- **High Precision**: Accurately supports timings below 10ms.
- **Random Offset Support**: Adds variability to clicking patterns.
- **Customizable Hotkey**: Set your preferred activation key.
- **Simple GUI**: Easy-to-use graphical interface.

## Warning

Be careful setting interval values below 10ms! Unlike other autoclickers such as OpAutoClicker, this will actually push for those intervals and may cause the program as well as the program you're running to not respond or stutter.

2. Run the installer and follow the setup instructions.
